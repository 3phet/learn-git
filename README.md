# learn-git

## Background

This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe with all parts implemented except for two methods. At this time, it does not:

- take a player's move and add it to the board
- correctly check for a tied game when there is no winner

Your job is to find a partner and implement each method individually, then review each other's code and merge them using Git.

## Instructions

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your partner as a collaborator in your forked repo
3. Clone the repository to your local machine
4. Create your own branch where you implement and test EITHER `playerTurn(...)` OR `checkTie()`
5. Create pull requests into master (make sure to select your own repo) and review your partner's code before you merge
6. Ask questions! :)
